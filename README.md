# Stochastic Modelling: Software Reliability
This report aims to estimates the time before a software package is ready for release using a stochastic model. For this purpose statistical tools such as Maximum Likelihood Estimators and multinomial random variables are used.

This reports consists of three parts: (1) developing the model,  (2) estimating the model parameters and (3) calculating the time before the software ready for release.
